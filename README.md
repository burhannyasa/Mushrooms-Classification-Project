# Mushrooms-Classification-Project
This project aims to develop a supervised machine learning model to classify mushrooms as edible, poisonous, or of unknown edibility, with the latter grouped with poisonous for safety. By exploring various classification algorithms, we seek to uncover patterns in the mushroom dataset, ensuring informed and safe consumption decisions.
